\arguments{
\item{Y}{an \eqn{n \times p} data matrix. For single cell data, this should
be a cells by genes matrix. Must be convertible to an object of
type \code{dgCMatrix}.}

\item{K}{rank of the factorization. Must be specified unless
\code{init_LL} and \code{init_FF} are provided.}

\item{s}{size factor for each row of \code{Y} used to scale the link function
(see Details). The default value of \code{NULL} will
use the row sums of \eqn{Y} scaled to have an average value of \eqn{1}.
Custom size factors can be provided with a numeric vector of length \eqn{n}.
If set to \code{FALSE}, no size factors will be used.}

\item{cc}{value of \code{c} in the link function. See Details.}

\item{init_LL}{initial value of \eqn{L}.}

\item{init_FF}{initial value of \eqn{F}.}

\item{loglik}{character string specifying the log-likelihood to optimize.
Setting this to \code{"approx"} will approximate the log-likelihood
corresponding to the \eqn{0} values of \eqn{Y} with a quadratic.
\code{"exact"} optimizes the true log-likelihood. Generally, this
approximation works poorly for values of \eqn{c} small relative to \eqn{1}
and well for values of \eqn{c} large relative to \eqn{1}. Thus, the
\code{"default"} method will use the approximate log likelihood for values
of \eqn{c \geq 1}.}

\item{init_method}{Method for initialization (ignored if \code{init_LL}
and \code{init_FF} are specified). \code{"random"} will initialize \eqn{L}
and \eqn{F} to small positive values generated from an exponential
distribution. \code{"rank1"} will initialize the first factor by fitting
a model with \eqn{K = 1} to the data, with all other factors initialized to
small positive values from an exponential distribution.}

\item{approx_technique}{technique used for quadratic approximation of terms
corresponding to \eqn{0} values of \eqn{Y} in the log likelihood. Method
\code{"taylor"} uses a second order Taylor approximation of \eqn{\exp(x)}
about \eqn{x = 0}. Method \code{"chebyshev"} uses the Chebyshev coefficients
to find the best quadratic approximation of \eqn{\exp(x)} in the
interval \code{chebyshev_interval}.}

\item{chebyshev_interval}{a sorted numeric vector of length 2
(e.g. \code{c(0, 1)}) specifying the interval for Chebyshev approximation of
the terms of the log likelihood correspond to \eqn{0} values of \eqn{Y}. Only
used when \code{loglik} is set accordingly and when \code{approx_technique}
is set to \code{"chebyshev"}. By default, the interval is set to
\eqn{[0, \log(1 + 1/c)]}, which best approximates values of \eqn{\lambda}
between \eqn{0} and \eqn{1}. See Details for more information.}

\item{control}{a list of control parameters.}
}
\value{
a list containing the fitted values of \eqn{L} and \eqn{F}.

\description{
Fit a Poisson non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) model with
log1p link using (approximate) maximum likelihood.
}
\details{
Here, we fit the model
\deqn{y_{ij} \sim \textrm{Poisson}(s_{i}\lambda_{ij})}
\deqn{\log(1 + \lambda_{ij} / c) = \sum_{k = 1}^{K} \ell_{ik}f_{jk},} where
\eqn{Y} is an \eqn{n \times p} matrix of non-negative counts, \eqn{L} is a
non-negative \eqn{n \times K} matrix of "loadings," \eqn{F} is a
non-negative \eqn{p \times K} matrix of "factors," \eqn{s_{i}} is a
"size-factor" controlling for the total size of the \eqn{i^{\textrm{th}}}
row of \eqn{Y}, and \eqn{c} is a tuning parameter controlling the shape of
the link function.

Exact optimization of the log-likelihood of this function can be slow, owing
mostly to the fact that \eqn{\exp(\sum_{k = 1}^{K} \ell_{ik}f_{jk})} must be
calculated for all \eqn{np} entries in \eqn{Y}. Especially for very sparse
data \eqn{Y}, the value of \eqn{\sum_{k = 1}^{K} \hat{\ell}_{ik}\hat{f}_{jk}}
evaluated at the maximum likelihood estimates \eqn{\hat{L}} and \eqn{\hat{F}}
is likely to be small for indices \eqn{(i, j)} where \eqn{y_{ij} = 0}. Thus,
we provide an approximate log-likelihood technique which approximates only
terms in the log-likelihood corresponding to indices \eqn{(i, j)} where
\eqn{y_{ij} = 0}. This approximation involves assumes
\eqn{\exp(x) \approx a_{0} + a_{1}x + a_{2}x^{2}} for some constants
\eqn{a_{0}}, \eqn{a_{1}}, and \eqn{a_{2}}. Selection of these constants can
be done either by a second order Taylor expansion about \eqn{x = 0} or by
optimizing a Chebyshev polynomial in a specified interval. Use of the
approximate technique can substantially increase the speed of computation,
but due to loss of accuracy we do not encourage it's use for values of
\eqn{c} smaller than \eqn{1}.
